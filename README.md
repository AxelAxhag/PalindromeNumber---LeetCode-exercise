# PalindromeNumber---LeetCode-exercise
Thought I'd upload my code for the Palindrome Number exercise from LeetCode.com. 
The runtime results vary (5th percentile - 41st percentile). 
So does the memory usage (16th percentile - 59th percentile).

A palindrome number is a number that is the same forwards as backwards. For example 12321 or 65456.
